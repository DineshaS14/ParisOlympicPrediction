# TokyoOlympicPrediction
This project demonstrates the application of data analytics in understanding and predicting Olympic performance. By leveraging historical data and advanced modeling techniques, the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to medal outcomes and offers predictions for future Olympic events. Future enhancements could involve incorporating additional variables or refining models to improve prediction accuracy.

Data Preparation and Cleaning: Initial steps involve loading data from Excel files, converting them to CSV format, and cleaning to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses reveal patterns and relationships in the data, such as the distribution of total medals and correlations between variables.
Predictive Modeling: Aggregated data is used to build regression models for predicting medal counts in the upcoming Olympics.
Conclusion: Insights and predictions derived from the analysis are summarized, emphasizing the project's findings and implications for understanding and forecasting Olympic performance.

Data Files: Includes CSV files (Athletes.csv, Coaches.csv, EntriesGender.csv, Medals.csv, Teams.csv) containing cleaned and processed data used in the analysis.
Python Scripts: Code scripts (OlympicPredictorDataSet2021.py) used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
